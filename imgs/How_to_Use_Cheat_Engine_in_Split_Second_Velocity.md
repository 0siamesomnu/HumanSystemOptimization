Cheat Engine is a free software that allows you to modify any single-player game running on your PC. You can change values such as health, money, speed, and more. In this article, we will show you how to use Cheat Engine in Split Second Velocity and give you some examples of cheats you can try.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install Cheat Engine
 
The first thing you need to do is download and install Cheat Engine from its official website[^3^]. Make sure you choose the latest version and follow the installation instructions. You may need to disable your antivirus software temporarily as some programs may flag Cheat Engine as a potential threat.
 
## Step 2: Open Split Second Velocity and Cheat Engine
 
Next, launch Split Second Velocity and start a race. Then, switch to Cheat Engine and click on the computer-shaped icon in the top-left corner. This will open a list of processes running on your PC. Find the one that corresponds to Split Second Velocity (usually named splitsecond.exe) and select it. Click on Open to attach Cheat Engine to the game process.
 
## Step 3: Scan for Values
 
Now comes the fun part. In Cheat Engine, you can scan for values that you want to change in the game. For example, if you want to increase your money, you need to find out how much money you have in the game. Then, enter that amount in the Value box in Cheat Engine and click on First Scan. This will search for all the addresses that have that value in the game memory.
 
Then, go back to the game and spend or earn some money. Note down your new money amount and enter it in the Value box in Cheat Engine. Click on Next Scan. This will narrow down the list of addresses to only those that have changed to your new value. Repeat this process until you have only one or a few addresses left.
 
## Step 4: Change Values
 
Once you have found the address that corresponds to the value you want to change, double-click on it to add it to the table below. You can also rename it for convenience. Then, double-click on the Value column and enter any amount you want. For example, if you want to have 999999 money, just type that number and press Enter. Go back to the game and see your money change instantly.
 
You can also check the box next to the address to freeze it, which means it will not change even if you spend or earn money in the game. You can also change other values such as power plays, lap time, speed, etc. by following the same steps.
 
## Some Examples of Cheats
